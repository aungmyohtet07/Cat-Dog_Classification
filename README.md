# Cat-Dog_Classification
This is the implementation of the classification of dogs and cats with the framework of pytorch.</br>
The dataset, which is from Kaggle, is downloaded first to the local computer and uploaded to Google Drive.</br>
The Pretrained model, Densenet from Imagenet, is used and the classification layer is tweaked to accomplish the required task.</br>
Inspired from one of the Udacity projects.
