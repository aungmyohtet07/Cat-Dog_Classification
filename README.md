# Cat & Dog Classification
* This is an implementation of __the classification of cats and dogs__ with the framework of __Pytorch__ with the dataset from Kaggle.</br>
* The pretrained model, __Densenet from Imagenet__, is used, and the classification layer was tweaked to accomplish the required task.</br>
Inspired from one of the Udacity projects.
